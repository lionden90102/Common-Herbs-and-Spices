                <th class="dill">
                    1.Dill, Dill comes from South-West Asia or South-East Europe. Dill has a deliciously fresh,
                    citrus-like taste, with a slightly grassy undertone. Dill is commonly used in Mediterranean cooking
                    and pairs particularly well with fish, pickled vegetables, light salads, creamy dressings, and egg
                    dishes.

                <th class="cardamom">
                    2.Cardamom, Cardamom is made from the fruits, or seeds, of the Elettaria cardamomum. Native to the
                    moist forests of southern India, The Queen of Spice is most commonly cultivated in India, Sri Lanka,
                    and Guatemala. Cardamom has a unique and distinctive flavor. It's challenging to describe but has
                    peppery, piney, eucalyptus, and menthol-like notes, but the taste of cardamom is also floral with
                    hints of citrus. This blend of sweet, peppery, pungent, and aromatic flavors actually makes it an
                    incredibly versatile spice. You'll often find it in Indian and Scandinavian cuisines, where the
                    seeds and pods are sauteed with savory meats and vegetables, or added to mulled or infused
                    beverages. In ground form it makes a lovely addition to baked goods, glazes, and dressings.
                </th>
                <th class="lavender">
                    3.Lavender, It is widely believed that lavender first originated from the Mediterranean, the Middle
                    East and India, around 2500 years ago. It's known that the Egyptians made perfumes with lavender and
                    when Tutankhamun's tomb was opened, traces of lavender were found and its scent could still be
                    detected. On its own, lavender has a distinctive taste that's floral with hints of mint and rosemary
                    (two plants to which it's related) and, used correctly, it makes the perfect flavoring for spring.
                    Dried lavender is just that: the edible flowers of the lavender plant. Dried lavender can be used in
                    rubs, marinades, sauces, cookies and sorbet. It can also be added to a simple syrup mixture and used
                    to flavor summer drinks like cocktails, lemonade or iced tea. Shopping Tip: Be sure to purchase
                    lavender for cooking as opposed to lavender sold at craft shops.

                <th class="cayenne">
                    4.Cayenne, The cayenne pepper is one of many chili pepper cultivars of Capsicum annuum and is said
                    to have originated in Cayenne, French Guiana. The spice is produced by drying and grinding the
                    orange to deep-red fruits and derives its piquant flavor from the chemical capsaicin. The primary
                    flavor of cayenne is defined by a hot, fiery effect on the taste buds. Despite the heat contained in
                    these red peppers, cayenne has a fairly mild aroma. Given its high heat levels, cayenne is best used
                    in small amounts while cooking to guarantee this concentrated spice doesn't overtake a dish. What
                    Are the Culinary Uses for Cayenne Pepper? Given its Central American origins, cayenne pepper is best
                    known for its role in Mexican cooking, used daily to flavor robust spicy sauces, meat marinades, and
                    traditional dishes like enchiladas, tacos, and fajitas.

                <th class="lemon_grass">
                    5.Lemon Grass, Multiple species of lemongrass are native to various Southeast Asian countries, with
                    Malaysia being considered the specific point of origin for Cymbopogon citratus. The first record of
                    cultivation dates back to 17th century texts from the Philippines. Lemongrass is said to taste like
                    mild citrus with a hint of ginger. Named so for its lemony aroma, this herb actually possesses the
                    same oils as the lemon fruit and is often used as a substitute for lemon flavoring. Fresh lemongrass
                    may also offer notes of bright floral and cooling mint. Lemongrass helps soups, salads, and curries
                    pop, and it's also used to add a citrusy flavor to roasted meats. The outer leaves can also be dried
                    and brewed into a tea, or chopped fresh and utilized in a cocktail.

                <th class="chile_pepper">
                    6.Chile Pepper, Chile peppers originated in the lowlands of Brazil as small red, round, “berry-like”
                    fruits. This location is called the 'nuclear area' and has the greatest number of wild species of
                    chile peppers in the world. While some peppers are so hot it can be challenging to recall their
                    other attributes, fresh chiles are full of crisp texture and flavor, ranging from pungent and grassy
                    to fruity. On the other end of the spectrum, velvety-soft roasted peppers tend to be smoky and a
                    little sweeter. Chili peppers make a spicy addition to all kinds of dishes—Italian arrabbiata,
                    Chinese Kung Pao chicken, Mexican mole sauce and Indian curry are some of our favorites.
                </th>
                <th class="marjoram">
                    7.Marjoram, Marjoram is indigenous to Cyprus, the Mediterranean, Turkey, Western Asia, the Arabian
                    Peninsula, and the Levant, and was known to the ancient Greeks and Romans as a symbol of happiness.
                    It may have spread to the British Isles during the Middle Ages. What Does Marjoram Taste Like? The
                    primary flavor compounds in marjoram are sabinene (fresh, woody), terpinene (citrusy), and linalool
                    (floral). Marjoram has a milder flavor than oregano and tastes similar to thyme, but sweeter and
                    with a stronger scent. It's warm, slightly sharp, and a little bitter. Dried marjoram is a popular
                    addition to salad dressings, meat dishes, and preserved meats such as German sausage. Used in both
                    fresh and dried form, marjoram is subtler than its relative oregano and well suited to delicate
                    vegetables, tomato-based dishes, such as tomato sauce and pizza, and poultry seasoning.

                <th class="cinnamon">
                    8.Cinnamon, Cinnamon is native to Sri Lanka, India, and Myanmar. It is also cultivated in South
                    America and the West Indies. What does cinnamon taste like? Cinnamon's distinctly sweet yet smokey
                    flavour comes from the aromatic oil that makes up to 1% of its composition. Ceylon cinnamon's
                    flavour and aroma are particularly subtle and delicate, almost floral, while Chinese cassia has a
                    strong, woody and bitter flavour. It is used to flavour curry on the Indian subcontinent, savoury
                    chicken and lamb dishes in the Middle East, and chocolate and yams in Mexico. In the West it is
                    popular in baked goods like cinnamon rolls and cookies, or with apples and pears in hearty pies,
                    crumbles and cobblers.

                <th class="mint_leaves">
                    9.Mint Leaves, Mint originated in the Mediterranean and was later introduced to Britain and
                    eventually America. It dates back to Ovid. The primary flavor profile of mint is a subtly sweet
                    taste and cool sensation that comes from the menthol contained in the herb. This chemical sends a
                    message to the brain that it's consuming something cold, triggering a chilly sensation that gives
                    the effect that the herb is cooling the mouth. Fresh (or dried) mint makes an excellent addition to
                    meatballs and lamb burgers, to add a bit of Middle Eastern flair (mint is used extensively in many
                    Middle Eastern cuisines). In desserts, fresh mint and mint oil (in candies like peppermints and
                    chocolates) stars.

                <th class="cloves">
                    10.Cloves, Cloves come from the flower buds of an evergreen tree that is native to the North
                    Moluccas Islands in Indonesia. Clove trees grow to about 26-40 feet and flower after about 6 years.
                    The tree becomes fully mature in 20 years and can bear fruit for more than 80 years. The flavor of
                    Cloves are strong, pungent, sweet--almost hot. They are one of the most penetrating of all spices
                    and their bitter, astringent flavor flavor leaves a numbing sensation in the mouth. What Are the
                    Culinary Uses for Cloves? Cloves are commonly used in spice blends for meat rubs and marinades,
                    including the popular blends Chinese five-spice powder and garam masala. They're one of many spices
                    used to make Vietnamese pho, and they stud whole-baked hams and pots of German braised red cabbage.
