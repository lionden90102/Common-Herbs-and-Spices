    <h1>Common Herbs and Spices</h1>
        <div class="dill">1.Dill, Dill comes from South-West Asia or South-East Europe. Dill has a deliciously fresh, citrus-like taste, with a slightly grassy undertone. Dill is commonly used in Mediterranean cooking and pairs particularly well with fish, pickled vegetables, light salads, creamy dressings, and egg dishes.</div>
        <div class="cardamom">2.Cardamom, Cardamom is made from the fruits, or seeds, of the Elettaria cardamomum. Native to the moist forests of southern India, The Queen of Spice is most commonly cultivated in India, Sri Lanka, and Guatemala. Cardamom has a unique and distinctive flavor. It's challenging to describe but has peppery, piney, eucalyptus, and menthol-like notes, but the taste of cardamom is also floral with hints of citrus. This blend of sweet, peppery, pungent, and aromatic flavors actually makes it an incredibly versatile spice. You'll often find it in Indian and Scandinavian cuisines, where the seeds and pods are sauteed with savory meats and vegetables, or added to mulled or infused beverages. In ground form it makes a lovely addition to baked goods, glazes, and dressings.</div>
        <div class="lavender">3.Lavender, It is widely believed that lavender first originated from the Mediterranean, the Middle East and India, around 2500 years ago. It's known that the Egyptians made perfumes with lavender and when Tutankhamun's tomb was opened, traces of lavender were found and its scent could still be detected. On its own, lavender has a distinctive taste that's floral with hints of mint and rosemary (two plants to which it's related) and, used correctly, it makes the perfect flavoring for spring. Dried lavender is just that: the edible flowers of the lavender plant. Dried lavender can be used in rubs, marinades, sauces, cookies and sorbet. It can also be added to a simple syrup mixture and used to flavor summer drinks like cocktails, lemonade or iced tea. Shopping Tip: Be sure to purchase lavender for cooking as opposed to lavender sold at craft shops.</div>
        <div class="cayenne">4.Cayenne, The cayenne pepper is one of many chili pepper cultivars of Capsicum annuum and is said to have originated in Cayenne, French Guiana. The spice is produced by drying and grinding the orange to deep-red fruits and derives its piquant flavor from the chemical capsaicin. The primary flavor of cayenne is defined by a hot, fiery effect on the taste buds. Despite the heat contained in these red peppers, cayenne has a fairly mild aroma. Given its high heat levels, cayenne is best used in small amounts while cooking to guarantee this concentrated spice doesn't overtake a dish. What Are the Culinary Uses for Cayenne Pepper? Given its Central American origins, cayenne pepper is best known for its role in Mexican cooking, used daily to flavor robust spicy sauces, meat marinades, and traditional dishes like enchiladas, tacos, and fajitas.</div>
